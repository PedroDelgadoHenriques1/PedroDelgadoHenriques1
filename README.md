## 🎯 Professional Focus (Tier 1 / Tier 2)

### 🥇 Tier 1 — C++ / Low-Level Graphics Programming
I’m currently directing my portfolio toward **low-level graphics programming**, focusing on:
- **C++ (C++98/11)**
- **Vulkan / OpenGL** (rendering pipeline, buffers, shaders, synchronization, GPU/CPU flow)
- Engine structures: **ECS**, math (vectors/matrices), asset pipeline, build systems
- Best practices: **architecture, performance, debugging, testing, and code quality**

### 🥈 Tier 2 — C# / .NET / Unity
I’m also open to roles and projects focused on:
- **C# / .NET**
- **Unity (runtime, gameplay systems, editor/tooling, optimization)**
- Engineering workflow: Git, CI/CD, automated testing

---

## 🧠 About me
I’m a **Software Engineer** with ~**4 years of experience** building software (including **games**, teaching/mentoring, and production systems).  
My current goal is to build a strong portfolio in **Graphics/Engine Programming**, working on teams that value **low-level development, performance, and clean architecture**.
